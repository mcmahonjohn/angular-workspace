# Background Information

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing a basic feature in your repository. The implementation follows modern development practices and includes proper documentation, testing, and error handling.

## Context

When working with any codebase, it's essential to understand the project structure, dependencies, and coding standards before implementing new features. This documentation serves as a starting point for contributors and developers looking to extend the functionality of the project.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of the programming language used in this repository
- Development environment properly configured
- Access to the repository and necessary permissions
- Familiarity with version control (Git)

# Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

## Step 1: Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install required dependencies
3. Verify your development environment is working correctly
4. Create a new branch for your feature implementation

## Step 2: Code Implementation

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory in the project structure
2. Create new files as needed following the project's naming conventions
3. Implement the core functionality with proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive comments and documentation

Note: If your project includes Angular migration schematics (versioned `update-*` scripts used by `ng update`), place those entries in a separate `migrations.json` and reference it from `package.json` via the `migrations` field. Do not duplicate those versioned migrations in your public `collection.json` unless you intentionally want them runnable via `ng generate`. For testing, consider using a `test-collection.json` that includes migrations only for the test runner.

## Step 3: Testing

1. Write unit tests for your implementation
2. Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions
3. Perform manual testing of the new feature
4. Update integration tests if necessary

## Step 4: Documentation

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Add inline code comments where appropriate
3. Update API documentation if applicable
4. Create or update user-facing documentation

## Step 5: Code Review and Submission

1. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages
2. Push your branch to the remote repository
3. Create a pull request with detailed description
4. Address feedback from code reviewers
5. Merge the feature once approved

## Best Practices

- Follow the established coding standards
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include appropriate error handling
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document your code thoroughly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. Check the project's issue tracker for known problems
2. Verify your environment setup matches the requirements
3. Review similar implementations in the codebase
4. Consult the project's contribution guidelines
5. Reach out to maintainers for guidance
